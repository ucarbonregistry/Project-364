Purpose of the project activity:
The Alchem Biomass to Energy Project –Neemrana Rajasthan is located at SP-2-5, RIICO Industrial Area,
Neemrana, Rajasthan India.
 The purpose of the project activity is the set up of Boiler of 8TPH capacitiy to generate steam using biomass
(rice husk) as fuel.

The Project Proponents hopes that carbon revenues from 2013-2022 accumulated as a result of carbon credits
generated will help PP to invest in such renewal energy project like solar and in the continued maintenance
of this project activity.
